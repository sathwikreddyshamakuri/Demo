# Demo

A small playground of Python scripts that help me master core concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and basic file I/Oâ€”all on the road to a cloud-engineering career.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1 . Grab the code
git clone https://github.com/sathwikreddyshamakuri/Demo.git
cd Demo

# 2 . (Optional) create an isolated environment
python -m venv env
# macOS/Linux
source env/bin/activate
# Windows
.\env\Scripts\activate

# 3 . Install any dependencies (none yet, but ready for the future)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4 . Run an example script
python pattern_triangle.py
